/*
Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications —
all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.

All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use. 
This is to prevent issues with future compiler versions potentially introducing changes that would break your code.
